# AutoRejoin
Automatically rejoins the server between 1:00-2:00am, after the usual server reset that takes place around 12:00-1:00am. So I can AFK all night! The program shuts down after it rejoins. time.sleep for half an hour inbetween checking the time to save on CPU power. I tried to make the typing look natural so I don't get banned for using a "bot". I'll add some randomization to the delays later.
