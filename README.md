# AutoRejoin
This is for a minecraft server that I don't want to name just in case (........this is against the server rules). This program automatically rejoins the server between 1:00-2:00am, after the usual server reset that takes place around 12:00-1:00am. So I can AFK all night! The program shuts down after it rejoins the server. I tried to make the typing look natural so I don't get banned for using a "bot". I'll add some randomization to the delays later.
